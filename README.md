# capacitated-clustering-problem
This repository includes the source code of the proposed FITS and MA algorithm published in an EJOR paper titled with "Heuristic search to the capacitated clustering problem".

The three sets of 133 benchmark instances are from CCPLIB available from http://www.optsicom.es/ccp/. To facilitate the further research, we upload the instances here.
